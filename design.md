This is a two-part project:

First: we'll create something very akin to a web-based CSO blotter.  This will be a web view showing a log in which each entry briefly details an event the CSOs responded to on campus. There will be sorting and filtering capabilities of a relatively high-level sort: 

- Category of response (e.g. AOD, Injury, Student Locked out of Dorm Room)
- Occurrence, both in terms of time range (last 7 days) and time of day
  ("things which happened between 10pm and 5am")


Database:
-CSOs
-locations on campus
-type of incident

Questions:
-will CSOs be identified in the blotter
-will CSOs be entering this info themselves (from e.g. ipads) or will the dispatcher be doing it?
-will it be updated on an ongoing basis or at the end of the day, or something else?
-Do the CSOs have a database of sorts with this information that we can copy from? (e.g. categories of incidents, coded locations, etc.) - is it stored digitally, can we use it?
-who is the intended audience? who will have access?
-What should the sorting feature look like? A drop-down menu?
-Should CSOs need to log in to update?
-How should campus be split up, esp. non-buildings (e.g. "Reed lake", "southeastern front lawn"), and should the locations on the map be specifically exactly where the event happened, or should they just show the region?


Sorting capabilities:
	-sort by CSO
	-sort by incident
	-sort by date & time range




Next, we'll work with Justine Wang, who has been building maps of the campus, and the Strabo team to put a web front-end on this "blotter", allowing the events to be showing across the campus with the same filtering as the blotter. A person should be able to click back and forth between an event on a map and the blotter description of it.
